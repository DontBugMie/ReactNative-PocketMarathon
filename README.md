# ReactNative-PocketMarathon


Welcome kind humans! 

Pocket Marathon is a react native project inspired by couch to 5k. Weather your wanting to loose the lockdown pounds or you just want to get healthier, Pocket Marathon is the app for you. 
Pocket Marathon allows users to personalise their workouts to fit their abilities and needs for that session. 

Pocket Marathon is still a work in progress. Features that will be added in the near future: 
                               - Auditory feedback to let you know when you should speed up or slow down
                               - workout calendar contributions. Be able to see when you worked out in a colour coded calendar similar to the git hub contributions calendar. 
                               - Compete against mates 
                               - Compete against your last / best run times.
